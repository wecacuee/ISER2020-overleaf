% Consider the problem of active exploration, which seeks to find the optimal
% sequence of actions $\bfu$ that lead maximum gain in map-belief $\bel(\bfm)$
% information,
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%   \max_{\bfu_k} \sum_{t=k}^T &|\bbH(\bel(\bfm)_t) - \bbH(\bel_{t+1}(\bfm) | \bfx_t, \bfu_t)|
%   \\
%   \bfx_{t+1} &= f(\bfx_t, \bfu_t)
%   \\
%   \bfz_t &= g(\bfx_t)
%   \\
%   \bel_{t}(\bfm), \bfx_{t} &= \SLAM(\bel_{t-1}(\bfm), \bfx_{t-1}, \bfz_t, \bfu_t),
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% where $ \bel_t(\bfm) \triangleq \bbP(\bfm | \bfz_{1:t}, \bfu_{1:t})$ is the
% estimated map-belief at time $t$ or the probability of map given observations
% $\bfz_{1:t}$ up to time $t$.
% 
% This problem is understood to be intractable \TODO{citation needed}, hence only
% solved greedily.

We intend to capture the prior over map $\bbP(\bfm)$ using semantic patterns. Let the
map be composed of $n$ rooms $\bfr_i $, $\bfm = [\bfr_1; \dots; \bfr_n]$,
with respective semantic labels as $\bfc = [c_1; \dots; c_n]$.
Let the rooms be divided into a set of explored rooms $\bfm_e = \{ \bfr_e \mid
\exists t : \bfx_t \in \bfr_e \}$ and unexplored
rooms $\bfm_u = \{ \bfr_u \mid \forall t : \bfx_t \notin \bfr_u \}$, depending
upon whether the robot (position $\bfx_t$ ) has visited the room so far $\bfx_t
\in \bfr$.
We factorize the prior over map such that the observations $\bfz_{1:t}$ only
impact the estimation of explored rooms, while the unexplored rooms are only
based on prior,
\begin{align}
  \bbP(\bfm | \bfz_{1:t}, \bfu_{1:t}) = \bbP(\bfm_u | \bfm_e) \bbP(\bfm_e | \bfz_{1:t}, \bfu_{1:t}).
\end{align}
Here we assume that unexplored rooms $\bfm_u$ are independent of observations so
far, provided the explored rooms $ \bfm_u \perp \{ \bfz_{1:t}, \bfu_{1:t} \} | \bfm_e$.
To focus on capturing the semantic patterns, we further factorize the
conditional probability $\bbP(\bfm_u | \bfm_e)$ only through the corresponding
semantic labels of explored rooms $\bfc_e$ and unexplored rooms $\bfc_u$.
\begin{align}
  \bbP(\bfm_u | \bfm_e) &= \bbE_{\bfc_u, \bfc_e} \big[
  \bbP(\bfm_u | \bfc_u) \bbP(\bfc_u|\bfc_e) \bbP(\bfc_e | \bfm_e)
  \big].
\end{align}

This equation captures our basic assumption and in this work, we evaluate the
effectiveness of this assumption in exploration related tasks.
