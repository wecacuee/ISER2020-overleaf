\section{Conclusion}
We present a method for stochastic seeking in partially observable environments. 
We provide a method to  predict unseen portions of the map using image inpainting algorithms.
This allows us to compute information gain in the unseen parts of the map and hence plan efficiently for maximum information gain.
