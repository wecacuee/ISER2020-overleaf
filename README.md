##Notes:

Papers to ICRA can be submitted through two channels:

To ICRA. The page limit for each submission is flexible. However, the paper material (including text, figures, tables, acknowledgement, etc.) must fit into 6 pages, while there is no page limit for the bibliography/references (n pages) section. Papers exceeding the (6+n) page limit at the time of submission will be returned without review.
To the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. Select the option for presentation at ICRA. Six pages in standard ICRA format are allowed for each paper, including figures and references, and a maximum of two additional pages can be purchased. Details are provided on the RA-L webpage and FAQ. Papers submitted to RA-L with ICRA 2020 presentation option that are not accepted to RA-L but are accepted to ICRA 2020, must be reformatted to the (6+n) page limit described above in order to be published and presented at ICRA 2020.
All papers are to be submitted in PDF format. We strongly encourage authors to submit a video clip to complement the submission (Video submission deadline is September 22, 2019). Videos can be submitted for both ICRA contributed papers as well as RA-L with ICRA option. However, please note that video submissions for RA-L papers with ICRA presentation option are due at the time of RA-L submission and the deadline is September 10, 2019. All video submissions will be limited to a maximum of 3 mins.
